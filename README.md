### An easy mode for the retard.

![](https://files.catbox.moe/uj2h87.png)

*"if you decrease the amount of options a user has available
   you also decrease the amount of things he can possibly fuck up"*

You need a good anime model, like anythingv3 (https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0) and and the VAE to go along with it. Download these and select the model at the top and the VAE in settings.

Maybe not retard-oriented enough, so there may be more updates to further help the retard.

Just download as .zip and move into `stable-diffusion-webui/extensions`.
